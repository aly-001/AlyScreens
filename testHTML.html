    <h2>Hello! What's your background, and what are you working on?</h2>
    <p>
      I'm Ajay Goel, a software developer by trade, and I'm building
      <a href="https://www.gmass.co">GMass</a>, an email marketing plugin for
      Gmail. GMass is used by entrepreneurs and salespeople to send email
      campaigns from inside their Gmail accounts. The email campaigns can range
      from promotional campaigns to existing customers, cold email campaigns to
      prospects, or announcements to a list of subscribers.
